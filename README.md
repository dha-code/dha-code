## Welcome 👋

This is *dha-code*, a growing collection of projects where I **explore, experiment, and apply** data science concepts to real-world problems, continuously learning along the way.

I am a Data scientist-in-training with a strong background in computational biology, **passionate about leveraging AI and data-driven solutions** to solve practical challenges. </br>

## Why Data Science and AI

What draws me to data science and AI is the **blend of analytical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation**.

My journey from decoding the genetic blueprint, to data science and AI has showed me the power of **transforming raw data into actionable insights** — whether through machine learning models, predictive analytics, or automation.

For me, AI is a **bridge between science and real-world impact**, turning data into innovative solutions.
